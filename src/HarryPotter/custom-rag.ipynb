       "'my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against\\nGreyback’s insistence that we werewolves deserve blood, that we ought to\\nrevenge ourselves on normal people.”\\n“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a problem\\n—”\\nLupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of James. He\\ncalled it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many people were under the\\nimpression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit.”\\nHe accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of thanks,\\nlooking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a rush of excitement:\\nThis last mention of his father had reminded him that there was something he\\nhad been looking forward to asking Lupin.\\n“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”\\n“The Half-Blood what?”\\n“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recognition.\\n“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is this a title\\nyou’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought being ‘the Chosen One’\\nwould be enough.”\\n“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-Blood\\nPrince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his old Potions book.\\nHe wrote spells all over it, spells he invented. One of them was Levicorpus\\n—”\\n“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,” said Lupin\\nreminiscently. “There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldn’t\\nmove for being hoisted into the air by your ankle.”\\n“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used it on\\nSnape.”\\nHe tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway comment of no\\nreal importance, but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect; Lupin’s\\nsmile was a little too understanding.\\n\\nhands on the Prince’s book, and was determined to leave it where it was while\\nSnape remained on the lookout.\\n“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until you’ve heard me out.\\nNow, I’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of\\ninventing Dark spells —”\\n“He didn’t make a hobby of it —”\\n“He, he — who says it’s a he?”\\n“We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly. “Prince, Hermione,\\nPrince!”\\n“Right!” said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a\\nvery old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the\\ntable in front of Harry. “Look at that! Look at the picture!”\\nHarry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving\\nphotograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look too. The picture\\nshowed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not pretty; she looked\\nsimultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy brows and a long, pallid face.\\nUnderneath the photograph was the caption: EILEEN PRINCE, CAPTAIN OF THE\\nHOGWARTS GOBSTONES TEAM.\\n“So?” said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the picture\\nbelonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions.\\n“Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.”\\nThey looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione was trying to\\nsay. He burst out laughing.\\n“No way.”\\n“What?”\\n“You think she was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”\\n“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wizarding\\nworld! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s given themselves,\\nor it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No, listen! If, say, her father was\\n\\nlooked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. “Did I hear right? You’ve\\nbeen taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?”\\nShe looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her mind at once.\\n“It’s nothing,” he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. “It’s not like, you\\nknow, Riddle’s diary. It’s just an old textbook someone’s scribbled on.”\\n“But you’re doing what it says?”\\n“I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly, Ginny, there’s\\nnothing funny —”\\n“Ginny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at once. “We ought to\\ncheck that there’s nothing odd about it. I mean, all these funny instructions,\\nwho knows?”\\n“Hey!” said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-\\nMaking out of his bag and raised her wand.\\n“Specialis Revelio!” she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover.\\nNothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and\\ndirty and dog-eared.\\n“Finished?” said Harry irritably. “Or d’you want to wait and see if it does a\\nfew backflips?”\\n“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the book suspiciously. “I\\nmean, it really does seem to be . . . just a textbook.”\\n“Good. Then I’ll have it back,” said Harry, snatching it off the table, but it\\nslipped from his hand and landed open on the floor.\\nNobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book, and as he\\ndid so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the\\nsame small, cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his\\nbottle of Felix Felicis, now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk\\nupstairs.\\nThis Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.\\n\\n“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it was very\\npopular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. . . .”\\n“But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,” Harry\\npersisted.\\n“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of fashion like\\neverything else.”\\nHe looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, “James was a pureblood,\\nHarry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him ‘Prince.’”\\nAbandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you?”\\n“Definitely not.”\\n“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s helped me out\\na lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.”\\n“How old is this book, Harry?”\\n“I dunno, I’ve never checked.”\\n“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the Prince was at\\nHogwarts,” said Lupin.\\nShortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A Cauldron\\nFull of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone, once they had\\nglimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to go to bed. Harry and\\nRon climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic bedroom, where a camp bed had\\nbeen added for Harry.\\nRon fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his trunk and\\npulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before getting into bed.\\nThere he turned its pages, searching, until he finally found, at the front of the\\nbook, the date that it had been published. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither\\nhis father, nor his father’s friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago.\\nFeeling disappointed, Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the\\nlamp, and rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and\\nthe Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping\\nshadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .\\n\\nF\\n \\nCHAPTER  TEN\\nTHE HOUSE OF GAUNT\\nor the rest of the week’s Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the\\nHalf-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius\\nBorage’s, with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was raving about\\nHarry’s abilities, saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither\\nRon nor Hermione was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share\\nhis book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the\\nhandwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or\\nit might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was resolutely plowing on\\nwith what she called the “official” instructions, but becoming increasingly\\nbad-tempered as they yielded poorer results than the Prince’s.\\nHarry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been. Although\\nthe amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the\\nwhole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making, he had skimmed through it\\nsufficiently to see that there was barely a page on which the Prince had not\\nmade additional notes, not all of them concerned with potion-making. Here\\nand there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made\\nup himself.\\n“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry pointing some of\\nthese out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening. “It might have\\nbeen a girl. I think the handwriting looks more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”\\n\\nBrookstanton . . . but they don’t seem to fit at all. Judging by that note, the\\nperson who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort, and I can’t find a shred of\\nevidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do with him. . . . No,\\nactually, it’s about . . . well, Snape.”\\nShe looked nervous even saying the name again.\\n“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his chair.\\n“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood Prince\\nbusiness,” she said tentatively.\\n“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d’you think I feel about that\\nnow?”\\n“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, looking around to\\ncheck that they were not being overheard. “It’s just that I was right about\\nEileen Prince once owning the book. You see . . . she was Snape’s mother!”\\n“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ignored him.\\n“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny\\nannouncement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape, and\\nthen later an announcement saying that she’d given birth to a —”\\n“— murderer,” spat Harry.\\n“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right. Snape must have\\nbeen proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see? Tobias Snape was a Muggle\\nfrom what it said in the Prophet.”\\n“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side so he could\\nget in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . . He’s just like Voldemort.\\nPure-blood mother, Muggle father . . . ashamed of his parentage, trying to\\nmake himself feared using the Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new\\nname — Lord Voldemort — the Half-Blood Prince — how could Dumbledore\\nhave missed — ?”\\nHe broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop himself dwelling\\nupon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . . but as Hermione had just\\ninadvertently reminded him, he, Harry, had been taken in just the same. . . . In\\n\\na wizard whose surname was Prince, and her mother was a Muggle, then that\\nwould make her a ‘half-blood Prince’!”\\n“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”\\n“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”\\n“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”\\n“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever enough,”\\nsaid Hermione angrily.\\n“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not think girls are\\nclever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It’s the way he writes, I just know the\\nPrince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t got anything to do with it.\\nWhere did you get this anyway?”\\n“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a whole collection of\\nold Prophets up there. Well, I’m going to find out more about Eileen Prince if\\nI can.”\\n“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably.\\n“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” she shot at him, as\\nshe reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions awards!”\\nHarry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his contemplation of\\nthe darkening sky.\\n“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,” said Ron,\\nreturning to his copy of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.\\n“You don’t think I’m mad, wanting that book back, do you?”\\n“’Course not,” said Ron robustly. “He was a genius, the Prince.\\nAnyway . . . without his bezoar tip . . .” He drew his finger significantly\\nacross his own throat. “I wouldn’t be here to discuss it, would I? I mean, I’m\\nnot saying that spell you used on Malfoy was great —”\\n“Nor am I,” said Harry quickly.\\n“But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in no time.”\\n“Yeah,” said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his conscience\\n\\n“The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,” Harry said. “How many girls have\\nbeen Princes?”\\nHermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled and\\ntwitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron,\\nwho was trying to read it upside down.\\nHarry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of Advanced\\nPotion-Making back into his bag.\\n“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”\\n“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck! We’ll wait\\nup, we want to hear what he teaches you!”\\n“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched Harry leave\\nthrough the portrait hole.\\nHarry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to step hastily\\nbehind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner,\\nmuttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of dirty-looking playing cards,\\nreading them as she walked.\\n“Two of spades: conflict,” she murmured, as she passed the place where\\nHarry crouched, hidden. “Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten of spades:\\nviolence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly troubled, one who\\ndislikes the questioner —”\\nShe stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry’s statue.\\n“Well, that can’t be right,” she said, annoyed, and Harry heard her\\nreshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but a whiff of\\ncooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone,\\nthen hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventh-floor corridor\\nwhere a single gargoyle stood against the wall.\\n“Acid Pops,” said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall behind it\\nslid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed, onto which Harry\\nstepped, so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the brass\\nknocker that led to Dumbledore’s office.\\n\\npointing a sausage at her sternly, “because he’s better than you at Potions —”\\n“It’s got nothing to do with that!” said Hermione, her cheeks reddening. “I\\njust think it’s very irresponsible to start performing spells when you don’t\\neven know what they’re for, and stop talking about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his\\ntitle, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname, and it doesn’t seem as though he was a\\nvery nice person to me!”\\n“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly. “If he’d been a\\nbudding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting about being ‘half-\\nblood,’ would he?”\\nEven as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been pure-blood,\\nbut he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would worry about that\\nlater. . . .\\n“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough pure-blood\\nwizards left,” said Hermione stubbornly. “I expect most of them are half-\\nbloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they hate, they’d be\\nquite happy to let you and Ron join up.”\\n“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said Ron indignantly, a\\nbit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and\\nhitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. “My whole family are blood traitors!\\nThat’s as bad as Muggle-borns to Death Eaters!”\\n“And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically. “We’d be best pals\\nif they didn’t keep trying to do me in.”\\nThis made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile, and a\\ndistraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.\\n“Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this.”\\nIt was a scroll of parchment with Harry’s name written upon it in familiar\\nthin, slanting writing.\\n“Thanks, Ginny . . . It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” Harry told Ron and\\nHermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents.\\n“Monday evening!” He felt suddenly light and happy. “Want to join us in\\nHogsmeade, Ginny?” he asked.\\n\\nDumbledore had been. Snape’s pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin,\\nwas suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed\\nDumbledore.\\n“You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who invented\\nthem — I, the Half-Blood Prince! And you’d turn my inventions on me, like\\nyour filthy father, would you? I don’t think so . . . no!”\\nHarry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away\\ninto the darkness and out of sight.\\n“Kill me then,” panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only rage and\\ncontempt. “Kill me like you killed him, you coward —”\\n“DON’T —” screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly demented,\\ninhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelping, howling dog stuck\\nin the burning house behind them — “CALL ME COWARD!”\\nAnd he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit\\nhim across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of\\nlight burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have\\ngone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something\\nenormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered\\nbackward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself\\ninto a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the\\nground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast\\nflapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech —\\nHarry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his wand, hoping to\\ngive chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass, discarding\\ntwigs, he knew it would be too late, and sure enough, by the time he had\\nlocated his wand, he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape\\nhad managed to Disapparate just beyond the school’s boundaries.\\n“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around. “HAGRID?”\\nHe stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged\\n\\nstudent might have turned him against me? But there was more to it than that.\\nI should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still\\nmany stories circulating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark\\nwizard, which was how he had survived the Dark Lord’s attack. Indeed, many\\nof the Dark Lord’s old followers thought Potter might be a standard around\\nwhich we could all rally once more. I was curious, I admit it, and not at all\\ninclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle.\\n“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no\\nextraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a number of tight\\ncorners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends. He\\nis mediocre to the last degree, though as obnoxious and self-satisfied as was\\nhis father before him. I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of\\nHogwarts, where I believe he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to\\nbe killed in front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore\\nclose at hand.”\\n“And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never\\nsuspected you?” asked Bellatrix. “He has no idea of your true allegiance, he\\ntrusts you implicitly still?”\\n“I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you overlook\\nDumbledore’s greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of people. I spun\\nhim a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff, fresh from my Death\\nEater days, and he embraced me with open arms — though, as I say, never\\nallowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help. Dumbledore has been a\\ngreat wizard — oh yes, he has,” (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise),\\n“the Dark Lord acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that\\nDumbledore is growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook\\nhim. He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower\\nthan they once were. But through all these years, he has never stopped\\ntrusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord.”\\nBellatrix still looked unhappy, though she appeared unsure how best to\\n\\nDumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harry’s face.\\n“They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce their offspring’s obedience\\nwhile within their walls.”\\n“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what happened here, look\\nwhat happened to Morfin!”\\n“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he did not deserve to\\ndie as he did, blamed for murders he had not committed. But it is getting late,\\nand I want you to see this other memory before we part. . . .”\\nDumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell\\nsilent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had said it was the most\\nimportant one he had collected. Harry noticed that the contents proved\\ndifficult to empty into the Pensieve, as though they had congealed slightly;\\ndid memories go bad?\\n“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he had finally emptied\\nthe phial. “We shall be back before you know it. Once more into the Pensieve,\\nthen . . .”\\nAnd Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time right in\\nfront of a man he recognized at once.\\nIt was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to him bald\\nthat he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite\\ndisconcerting; it looked as though he had had his head thatched, though there\\nwas already a shiny Galleon-sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache,\\nless massive than it was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as\\nrotund as the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly\\nembroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His little feet\\nresting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged\\narmchair, one hand grasping a small glass of wine, the other searching\\nthrough a box of crystalized pineapple.\\nHarry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they\\nwere standing in Slughorn’s office. Half a dozen boys were sitting around\\nSlughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens.\\nHarry recognized Voldemort at once. His was the most handsome face and he\\n\\nSomehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore gave it.\\n“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time by an old\\nprofessor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who had been at Hogwarts\\nfor nearly fifty years.\\n“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had\\nadmired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that,\\nworking in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and\\nhandsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only\\nexist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know,\\nHarry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to\\npersuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he\\nwas, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.”\\n“I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain himself.\\n“Well, quite,” said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. “And now it is time to\\nhear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very old, very rich witch by\\nthe name of Hepzibah Smith.”\\nDumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out, and he tipped\\nthe swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he did so, “After you,\\nHarry.”\\nHarry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of\\nthe stone basin until his face touched them. He tumbled through dark\\nnothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady\\nwearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed\\nall around her, giving her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking\\ninto a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks\\nwith a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house-elf Harry had ever\\nseen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.\\n“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously. “He said he’d come at\\nfour, it’s only a couple of minutes to and he’s never been late yet!”\\nShe tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened up. The top\\n\\nslime like that Creevey in.”\\nMalfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and did a cruel\\nbut accurate impression of Colin: “‘Potter, can I have your picture, Potter?\\nCan I have your autograph? Can I lick your shoes, please, Potter?’”\\nHe dropped his hands and looked at Harry and Ron.\\n“What’s the matter with you two?”\\nFar too late, Harry and Ron forced themselves to laugh, but Malfoy seemed\\nsatisfied; perhaps Crabbe and Goyle were always slow on the uptake.\\n“Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ friend,” said Malfoy slowly. “He’s another\\none with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn’t go around with that\\njumped-up Granger Mudblood. And people think he’s Slytherin’s heir!”\\nHarry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely seconds away\\nfrom telling them it was him — but then —\\n“I wish I knew who it is,” said Malfoy petulantly. “I could help them.”\\nRon’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless than usual.\\nFortunately, Malfoy didn’t notice, and Harry, thinking fast, said, “You must\\nhave some idea who’s behind it all. . . .”\\n“You know I haven’t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell you?”\\nsnapped Malfoy. “And Father won’t tell me anything about the last time the\\nChamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty years ago, so it was before\\nhis time, but he knows all about it, and he says that it was all kept quiet and\\nit’ll look suspicious if I know too much about it. But I know one thing — last\\ntime the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it’s a\\nmatter of time before one of them’s killed this time. . . . I hope it’s Granger,”\\nhe said with relish.\\nRon was clenching Crabbe’s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would be a bit of\\na giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a warning look and said,\\n“D’you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught?”\\n“Oh, yeah . . . whoever it was was expelled,” said Malfoy. “They’re\\n\\npeople call pure-blood.” He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his\\noutstretched hand. He threw it into the basin and continued, “I mean, the rest\\nof us know it doesn’t make any difference at all. Look at Neville Longbottom\\n— he’s pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up.”\\n“An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’ do,” said Hagrid\\nproudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta.\\n“It’s a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Ron, wiping his sweaty brow\\nwith a shaking hand. “Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It’s ridiculous. Most\\nwizards these days are half-blood anyway. If we hadn’t married Muggles\\nwe’d’ve died out.”\\nHe retched and ducked out of sight again.\\n“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,” said Hagrid loudly\\nover the thuds of more slugs hitting the basin. “Bu’ maybe it was a good thing\\nyer wand backfired. ’Spect Lucius Malfoy would’ve come marchin’ up ter\\nschool if yeh’d cursed his son. Least yer not in trouble.”\\nHarry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t come much worse than\\nhaving slugs pouring out of your mouth, but he couldn’t; Hagrid’s treacle\\ntoffee had cemented his jaws together.\\n“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. “Gotta\\nbone ter pick with yeh. I’ve heard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How\\ncome I haven’t got one?”\\nFurious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.\\n“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said hotly. “If Lockhart’s\\nstill spreading that around —”\\nBut then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.\\n“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending\\nhim face first into the table. “I knew yeh hadn’t really. I told Lockhart yeh\\ndidn’ need teh. Yer more famous than him without tryin’.”\\n“Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.\\n\\narticle about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge, but he\\nwas forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry. Obviously, they\\ndidn’t want the truth to get out!”\\nHarry, who thought it most unlikely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire,\\nbut who was used to Luna repeating her father’s bizarre views as though they\\nwere fact, did not reply; they were already approaching Slughorn’s office and\\nthe sounds of laughter, music, and loud conversation were growing louder\\nwith every step they took.\\nWhether it had been built that way, or because he had used magical trickery\\nto make it so, Slughorn’s office was much larger than the usual teacher’s\\nstudy. The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson, and gold\\nhangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The\\nroom was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate\\ngolden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were\\nfluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompanied by what\\nsounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner; a haze of pipe smoke\\nhung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation, and a number of\\nhouse-elves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees,\\nobscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they\\nlooked like little roving tables.\\n“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and Luna had\\nsqueezed in through the door. “Come in, come in, so many people I’d like you\\nto meet!”\\nSlughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket.\\nGripping Harry’s arm so tightly he might have been hoping to Disapparate\\nwith him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the party; Harry seized Luna’s\\nhand and dragged her along with him.\\n“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of mine, author\\nof Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires — and, of course, his friend\\nSanguini.”\\n\\nHarry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He supposed he had\\nbeen pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain and, whatever he said\\nto the contrary, much too surprised that a Muggle-born should make a good\\nwitch.\\n“Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibility to say any\\nof this, “likes his comfort. He also likes the company of the famous, the\\nsuccessful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feeling that he influences these\\npeople. He has never wanted to occupy the throne himself; he prefers the\\nbackseat — more room to spread out, you see. He used to handpick favorites\\nat Hogwarts, sometimes for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their\\ncharm or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who\\nwould go on to become outstanding in their various fields. Horace formed a\\nkind of club of his favorites with himself at the center, making introductions,\\nforging useful contacts between members, and always reaping some kind of\\nbenefit in return, whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or\\nthe chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison\\nOffice.”\\nHarry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider,\\nspinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large\\nand juicy flies a little closer.\\n“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to turn you against Horace\\n— or, as we must now call him, Professor Slughorn — but to put you on your\\nguard. He will undoubtedly try to collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel\\nof his collection; ‘the Boy Who Lived’ . . . or, as they call you these days, ‘the\\nChosen One.’”\\nAt these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist\\nstole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago,\\nwords that had a horrible and particular meaning to him: Neither can live\\nwhile the other survives . . .\\nDumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they had passed\\nearlier.\\n“This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.”\\n\\nThey stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short round one, and\\nwaved their wands in one identical sweeping motion.\\nThe furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments re-formed in\\nmidair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books repaired themselves\\nas they landed upon their shelves; oil lanterns soared onto side tables and\\nreignited; a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glittering\\nacross the room and alighted, whole and untarnished, upon a desk; rips,\\ncracks, and holes healed everywhere, and the walls wiped themselves clean.\\n“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked Dumbledore loudly\\nover the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather clock.\\n“On the walls? Dragon,” shouted the wizard called Horace, as, with a\\ndeafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed itself back into the\\nceiling.\\nThere was a final plunk from the piano, and silence.\\n“Yes, dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally. “My last bottle, and\\nprices are sky-high at the moment. Still, it might be reusable.”\\nHe stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard\\nand held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid within.\\n“Hmm. Bit dusty.”\\nHe set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then that his gaze\\nfell upon Harry.\\n“Oho,” he said, his large round eyes flying to Harry’s forehead and the\\nlightning-shaped scar it bore. “Oho!”\\n“This,” said Dumbledore, moving forward to make the introduction, “is\\nHarry Potter. Harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, Horace\\nSlughorn.”\\nSlughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd. “So that’s how\\nyou thought you’d persuade me, is it? Well, the answer’s no, Albus.”\\nHe pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man\\ntrying to resist temptation.\\n\\nOTHER FOR NEITHER CAN LIVE WHILE THE OTHER SURVIVES. . . . THE ONE WITH THE\\nPOWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD WILL BE BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH\\nDIES . . .”\\nThe slowly revolving Professor Trelawney sank back into the silver mass\\nbelow and vanished.\\nThe silence within the office was absolute. Neither Dumbledore nor Harry\\nnor any of the portraits made a sound. Even Fawkes had fallen silent.\\n“Professor Dumbledore?” Harry said very quietly, for Dumbledore, still\\nstaring at the Pensieve, seemed completely lost in thought. “It . . . did that\\nmean . . . What did that mean?”\\n“It meant,” said Dumbledore, “that the person who has the only chance of\\nconquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly\\nsixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied\\nVoldemort three times.”\\nHarry felt as though something was closing in upon him. His breathing\\nseemed difficult again.\\n“It means — me?”\\nDumbledore took a deep breath.\\n“The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have meant you at\\nall. Sybill’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the\\nend of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix,\\nboth sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of\\ncourse, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.”\\n“But then . . . but then, why was it my name on the prophecy and not\\nNeville’s?”\\n“The official record was relabeled after Voldemort’s attack on you as a\\nchild,” said Dumbledore. “It seemed plain to the keeper of the Hall of\\nProphecy that Voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew\\nyou to be the one to whom Sybill was referring.”\\n“Then — it might not be me?” said Harry.\\n\\n— I’d have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I was Slytherin’s heir\\nfor a while . . . because I can speak Parseltongue. . . .”\\n“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly, “because\\nLord Voldemort — who is the last remaining descendant of Salazar Slytherin\\n— can speak Parseltongue. Unless I’m much mistaken, he transferred some of\\nhis own powers to you the night he gave you that scar. Not something he\\nintended to do, I’m sure. . . .”\\n“Voldemort put a bit of himself in me?” Harry said, thunderstruck.\\n“It certainly seems so.”\\n“So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately into\\nDumbledore’s face. “The Sorting Hat could see Slytherin’s power in me, and\\nit —”\\n“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to me, Harry.\\nYou happen to have many qualities Salazar Slytherin prized in his hand-\\npicked students. His own very rare gift, Parseltongue — resourcefulness —\\ndetermination — a certain disregard for rules,” he added, his mustache\\nquivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know\\nwhy that was. Think.”\\n“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I\\nasked not to go in Slytherin. . . .”\\n“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, beaming once more. “Which makes you very\\ndifferent from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly\\nare, far more than our abilities.” Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned. “If\\nyou want proof, Harry, that you belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more\\nclosely at this.”\\nDumbledore reached across to Professor McGonagall’s desk, picked up the\\nblood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. Dully, Harry turned it\\nover, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And then he saw the name engraved\\njust below the hilt.\\nGodric Gryffindor.\\n“Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, Harry,” said'"
